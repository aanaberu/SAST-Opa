# SAST-Opa

# Topic : SAST and OPA

The objective is to furnish users with comprehensive security data pertaining to the application, including Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Image Scanning, and utilize the Open Policy Agent (OPA) policy as code to enforce rigorous measures for compliance, as well as conducting regular security audits.

#### SAST : SAST stands for Static Application Security Testing, which is a type of security testing that examines the source code of an application to identify potential security vulnerabilities. It is typically performed early in the software development life cycle (SDLC) to detect and fix security issues before they become more costly to resolve.

#### DevSecOps : DevSecOps is a methodology that integrates security into the software development process, with the goal of improving the security of applications while maintaining agility and speed of development. SAST is a key component of DevSecOps, as it enables developers to identify and address security issues early in the development process.

#### SAST Tool:
Checkmarx : Checkmarx is a popular SAST tool that can be used to identify potential security vulnerabilities in source code. It works by analyzing the code to detect security issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

## Benfits
### Benfits of Static Application Security Testing :

By integrating SAST with the release process, the development team can catch potential security vulnerabilities early in the SDLC and address them before they are deployed to production. This helps to improve the overall security of the application while maintaining the speed and agility of the DevOps process.


### Benfits of SAST and OPA in overall Devops:

The integration of Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with Open Policy Agent (OPA) in DevOps can provide significant business value. Here are some examples:

Improved security: The integration of SAST with OPA can improve the overall security of the application. SAST tools can identify potential vulnerabilities in the code, while OPA can enforce policies around access control, data handling, and other security concerns. This can help to prevent security breaches and data leaks, which can be costly for businesses in terms of financial and reputational damage.

Cost savings: By catching security vulnerabilities early in the SDLC, businesses can avoid the cost of fixing them later in the development process or after the application is deployed. The integration of SAST with OPA can help to identify security issues early on, reducing the overall cost of development and maintenance.

Faster time-to-market: By integrating SAST with OPA into the DevOps pipeline, developers can quickly and easily identify and address security issues. This can help to speed up the development process and reduce the time it takes to bring the application to market.

Compliance: OPA can help to enforce compliance policies and regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. By integrating SAST with OPA, businesses can ensure that their applications comply with these regulations and avoid potential fines or legal issues.

Reputation management: Security breaches and data leaks can be damaging to a company's reputation. By integrating SAST with OPA, businesses can improve the overall security of their applications, reducing the risk of security incidents that could harm their reputation


## Usecase 

An end-to-end flow of Checkmarx integration with OPA:

1) Code Scan: A developer submits a code scan request through an API to Checkmarx. The request includes the code repository location and any specific parameters for the scan, such as the scan type, the target programming language, and the scope of the scan.

2) Checkmarx Scan: Checkmarx receives the scan request and initiates the scan process. The code is analyzed for potential security vulnerabilities using Checkmarx's pre-configured set of rules and policies.

2) Scan Results: Once the scan is complete, Checkmarx generates a report that includes the details of any vulnerabilities that were identified in the code. This report is sent back to the developer through the API to Release.

3) OPA Policy: Before the developer can access the Checkmarx report, an OPA policy check is performed. OPA checks whether the developer has the appropriate permissions to access the report, based on the role or other criteria specified in the OPA policy.

4) Policy Decision: OPA makes a decision on whether the developer is allowed to access the Checkmarx report based on the policy check. If the developer has the appropriate permissions, OPA grants access to the report. If not, the request is denied.

5) Report Access: If the developer is granted access to the Checkmarx report, they can view the vulnerabilities identified by Checkmarx and take appropriate action to remediate the issues. If the developer is denied access, they will receive an error message indicating that they do not have the necessary permissions to access the report.
